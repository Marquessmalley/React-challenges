Challenge: 

Create a React component called Counter that displays a counter value and two buttons, 
one for incrementing the counter and one for decrementing it. Initially, the counter value should be 
set to 0, and clicking the "Increment" button should increase the counter by 1, while clicking the "Decrement" 
button should decrease it by 1.

Constraints:

- The counter value should never go below 0 (i.e., it cannot be negative).
- Use React state to manage the counter value.
- The component should render the counter value and two buttons: "Increment" and "Decrement."
