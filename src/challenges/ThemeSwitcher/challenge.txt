Challenge: 

Create a "Theme Switcher" application using React and the useContext hook to manage the theme state.

Requirements:

Theme Context:

- Create a ThemeContext that manages the current theme state (light or dark) and provides it to child components.
- Use the useContext hook to access the theme state in child components.

Theme Toggle Button:

- Display a "Toggle Theme" button.
- When the button is clicked, toggle the theme between light and dark.

Themed Styling:

- Style your application with CSS to apply different styles based on the current theme.
- For example, use light background and dark text for the light theme, and vice versa for the dark theme.
