Challenge: 

Create a React component called ToDoList that allows users to add and
remove items from a to-do list. The component should have the following features:

- Display a list of to-do items.
- Provide an input field and an "Add" button to add new items to the list.
- Each to-do item in the list should have a "Delete" button to remove it from the list.


Constraints:

- Use React state to manage the list of to-do items.
- When the "Add" button is clicked, the new item should be added to the list.
- When a "Delete" button is clicked, the corresponding item should be removed from the list.
 -Ensure that you handle empty input (no blank items should be added to the list).
