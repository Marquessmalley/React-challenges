Challenge: 

Create a React component called RegistrationForm for user registration. The form 
should include fields for the user's name, email, and password. Implement basic form validation 
to ensure that:

Requirements:

- Use React state to manage the form fields and error messages.
- The name field is required and must contain at least two characters.
- The email field is required and must be a valid email address (you can use a basic regex pattern for email validation).
- The password field is required and must be at least eight characters long.
- Implement validation logic in the component to check user input against the specified criteria.
- Display error messages next to the corresponding fields when validation fails.
- Allow the user to submit the form if all fields are valid.
