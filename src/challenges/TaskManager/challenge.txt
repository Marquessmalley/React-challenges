- When a "Remove" button is clicked, the corresponding task should be removed from the list.

AddTask Component:
- Allow users to input a task description and add it to the list.
- Each new task should have a unique ID.

State Management:
- Use the useReducer hook to manage the list of tasks.
- Define actions such as "ADD_TASK" and "REMOVE_TASK" to modify the task list.
