Challenge: 

Create a React component called GitHubUser that allows users to search for a GitHub user by their username. 
When the user enters a GitHub username and clicks a "Search" button, the component should fetch the user's 
information from the GitHub API (you can use the GitHub REST API) and display their username, avatar, and a 
link to their GitHub profile.

Constraints:

- Use React state to manage the input field for the username and to display the user's information.
- Utilize Axios or the Fetch API to make a GET request to the GitHub API to retrieve user data.
- Display the fetched user's username, avatar image, and a link to their GitHub profile.
